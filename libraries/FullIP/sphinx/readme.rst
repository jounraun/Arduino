- Update FullIP.h according to your hardware

   - comment #define FULLIP_UIP to build with official shield (w5100) or
     uncomment it to build with enc28j60 and UIPEthernet
    
   - comment #define FULLIP_SD to disable SD or
     uncomment it to build ftpclient, httpserver, ...

In your sketch :

- Define a client (FTP in this example)

.. code-block:: c

 FtpClient ftpclient;

- Start it in your setup

.. code-block:: c

 ftpclient.begin(server_name,user_name,password);

- Get the file

.. code-block:: c
 
 ftpclient.getFile(filename,local_dir,remote_dir);

- And process it in your loop

.. code-block:: c

 ftpclient.maintain();

That's all !!!
